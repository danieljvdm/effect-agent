### Minor Changes

- [#124](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/pull/124) [`ce8b39c`](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/commit/ce8b39ce8f716c0a11c6394d136b67cb9be84588) Thanks [@danieljvdm](https://github.com/danieljvdm)! - Authorize every still-executable model-declared call in a fresh or resumed application Tool batch
  through a host-supplied Run option before durable preparation or Handler execution. Settle denied
  accepted work with a typed failure while preserving canonical Run, Turn, input, and Tool Call
  identity across recovery.

### Patch Changes

- [#109](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/pull/109) [`7c093ec`](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/commit/7c093ecfd900a0c55163fce76b0609d04434fa73) Thanks [@danieljvdm](https://github.com/danieljvdm)! - Bound each recovery pass to one verified canonical-history prefix read per Conversation.

- [#111](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/pull/111) [`c715f9f`](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/commit/c715f9f8e436fa85e8c1ef2b27f640e637ea52e4) Thanks [@danieljvdm](https://github.com/danieljvdm)! - Align every public package with the Effect 4.0.0-rc.110 family.

- [#111](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/pull/111) [`c715f9f`](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/commit/c715f9f8e436fa85e8c1ef2b27f640e637ea52e4) Thanks [@danieljvdm](https://github.com/danieljvdm)! - Fix `validateMcpDiscovery` reporting a permanent schema drift for MCP tools whose parameters or success type is a named, refined Schema (a branded ID, a bounded string, a `Schema.Class`) — both schema derivations now resolve a top-level `$ref` before comparison.

## 0.1.0-beta.19

### Minor Changes

- [#105](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/pull/105) [`b8beef5`](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/commit/b8beef5624f6704b0e52b5023babd1272d6b0603) Thanks [@danieljvdm](https://github.com/danieljvdm)! - Require every failed canonical `SubmissionSettled` record to carry the exact bounded generic
  `{ errorTag, message }` diagnostic and expose it as `Settlement.failure`. Joined failure fanout,
  recovery, durable adapter finalization, and idempotent replay preserve the host's canonical
  diagnostic byte-for-byte. Result-less completed joins and aborted settlements remain explicitly
  valid; malformed private-development failed records now fail closed at Schema decode.

### Patch Changes

- [#106](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/pull/106) [`9e31de4`](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/commit/9e31de4c5f63ebc7eefbce33d3e0ed2052538f26) Thanks [@danieljvdm](https://github.com/danieljvdm)! - Expose host-supplied model-context preparation through Cloudflare Conversation Object options
  ([#49](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/issues/49)). A generic scoped `RunContextPreparation` service now composes after canonical durable
  resume reconstruction, `contextCompactorRunContextLayer` adapts the digest-bound
  `ContextCompactor` capability with typed failures, and `CloudflareDurableRuntimeOptions.runContext`
  accepts a closed Layer or per-incarnation Layer factory. Compaction changes only model-visible
  context; canonical history remains recoverable across Durable Object eviction and retries.

The coordinator now
  derives the logical Run deadline from its first canonical input record, so recovery and
  `waitingForChild` suspension cannot reset the parent allowance; queue time remains excluded and
  the engine's deadline option is tightening-only. Already-settled child joins remain mandatory
  recovery cleanup before an expired parent records its typed duration failure; cleanup authority
  names the exact open delegation Calls and duration interruption resumes before continuation.
  Adapter certification fixtures now keep their Run duration above the deliberate multi-round
  virtual lease-expiry horizon instead of relying on replacement Attempts to reset it.

  ordinary-completion values on canonical `SubmissionSettled` records across crash recovery and
  replay, including materialization through the public durable Settlement API.

Runtime and Cloudflare callers now subscribe
  before an authoritative canonical read, wake from post-commit hints without polling, broadcast to
  concurrent same-conversation waiters, clean up on interruption, and reconnect safely after Durable
  Object eviction. Cloudflare observation and resolution calls also preserve typed authorization
  denials, and the client Layer now requires an explicit `Crypto.Crypto` provider for cancellation
  identities.

Stable
  externally-driven waits now clear their alarm after acknowledging the observed maintenance
  generation, while pre-armed public and routed mutations, restart recovery, and bounded autonomous
  rearming preserve liveness. A caught-up forced alarm takes an O(1) maintenance-record path without
  recovery, ledger scans, or canonical-history reads. Child settlements also commit the parent's
  durable wake before child ledger finalization, preventing eviction from losing a quiescent join.

  record additively persists `exhausted` (`"tokens" | "tool-calls" | "turns"`) beside
  `finishReason: "budget-exhausted"` for a completed soft landing, and `policyLimit` (the typed
  `AgentPolicyError.limit`) beside the bounded `{errorTag, message}` failure projection for a
  `failed` hard-rail settlement — consumers read the dimension typed instead of parsing message
  text. Decode is family-bound fail-closed (`exhausted` only with the budget-exhausted
  finishReason, `policyLimit` only on a failed outcome) and histories persisted before the
  metadata existed keep decoding with it absent (schemaVersion 1 unchanged).
  `@effect-agent/core` now exports the `ExhaustedLimit` and `PolicyLimit` literal schemas backing
  the fields.

  enforced even when a token breach soft-lands the same response; tool results
  that cannot serialize become a bounded `UnserializableToolResult` sentinel
  instead of passing through unbounded; recovery re-seeds spend and derives
  token-exhaustion state (fail mode rejects an already-over-budget resume before
  any model call); compaction summarizer usage is staged into the canonical
  turn record; staged usage is validated as non-negative finite integers; and a
  provider-only breaching stop settles honestly as budget-exhausted.

  `TruncatedToolResult` envelopes), budget accounting becomes cache-aware with last-call
  live-context tracking, every request can carry a derived run-status message, the token
  dimension joins the `onExhaustion` soft landing (RUN-018) with the `exhausted` dimension marker,
  and the engine compacts natively at the pre-Turn seam (prune, then one metered summarize)
  with a canonical `CompactionCreated` record that projections fold across Runs; provider
  context-length rejections compact-and-retry once, then fail typed (`ContextOverflowError`).

### Patch Changes

- [#56](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/pull/56) [`5c49b78`](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/commit/5c49b786604b3e8389cdc2c54d4f5cb284eac2b7) Thanks [@danieljvdm](https://github.com/danieljvdm)! - Budget extension (D-037, ADR-0019 S3, RUN-021/SUB-034): `RunOptions` gains tightening-only
  `toolCallAllowance` and `turnAllowance` — the effective limit is
  `min(policy bound, max(1, floor(allowance)))`, never wider, and the `onExhaustion` soft landing
  keys off the effective limits. `Subagent.define` gains
  `toolCallAllowance: { default, fromParameters }`, clamped fail-closed to the delegation's
  per-invocation `SubagentPolicy.maxToolCalls` slice and threaded into ephemeral child runs, so an
  orchestrator model grants a scout more budget by re-delegating with a raised allowance (fresh
  child; never a mid-flight top-up). `projectResult` now receives a bounded
  `SubagentResultContext` whose `budgetExhausted` marker is honest on both paths — from the
  ephemeral child result's `finishReason`, or from the child Settlement's durable marker carried
  through the new optional `ChildEstablishSettled.finishReason` (threaded by the session
  coordinator shared by the DN and DC assemblies; exercised in the DN-profile durable-subagent
  suites) — so a budget-truncated partial can be surfaced in the declared success Schema. Existing one-argument `projectResult` functions keep
  compiling unchanged. Also hardens S2 containment per its autoreviewer findings: `Subagent.define`
  is overloaded so the Tool channels follow the `failureMode` value; genuine engine signals are
  classified by unspoofable provenance instead of `instanceof` on exported classes; each delegation
  exposes its canonical `containedFailure` schema (pr-review's coverage decoder now derives from
  it); and the pr-review child reviewer deliberately returns to typed exhaustion — a review is a
  coverage claim, so a budget-exhausted unit stays honestly unreviewed (contained as result data,
  never run-fatal).

### Minor Changes

- [#39](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/pull/39) [`e13ee6e`](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/commit/e13ee6e7817549e99837d06e86caf2dea8656aa8) Thanks [@danieljvdm](https://github.com/danieljvdm)! - Budget soft landing (D-037, ADR-0019, RUN-018/019/020): `AgentPolicy` gains
  `onExhaustion: "final-answer" | "fail"`, defaulting to `"final-answer"` — Turn and Tool Call
  exhaustion now settle the Run through one constrained final-answer opportunity instead of failing
  it. An over-budget Tool batch settles synthetically as model-visible failed results (no handler
  starts, no durable batch declaration, exempt from repeated-failure folding), subsequent model
  requests carry `toolChoice: "none"`, Turn exhaustion admits exactly one grace Turn, and the Run
  completes with the honest `finishReason: "budget-exhausted"` on the live event, the reduced
  `AgentResult`, and (additively) the durable `SubmissionSettled` record. Duration, token, cost, and
  repeated-failure bounds stay hard rails; `onExhaustion: "fail"` preserves the prior run-fatal
  behavior exactly. BEHAVIOR CHANGE ON UPGRADE: Turn/Tool-Call budget deaths become honest
  completions unless a policy pins `"fail"` — `@effect-agent/pr-review` pins `"fail"` pending its
  containment rework.

  surface — schema-first authoring (core), the bounded interpreter (engine),
  and operational capabilities — as one dependency-clean root package,
  mirroring how `effect` fronts the `@effect/*` satellites. Platform adapters

- Adopt the MIT license across every published package, and ship the Cloudflare

  class factory now carries an explicit `ConversationObjectClass` return type,
  which unblocks TypeScript declaration emit (TS4094). Supersedes the
  0.0.1-beta.2 round (and the Cloudflare pair's 0.0.1-beta.0), which was
  published out of band from an uncommitted tree, still UNLICENSED, and without
  `.d.mts` for the Cloudflare packages.

- Republish with correctly pinned internal dependencies. The 0.0.1-beta.0

  published (`workspace:*` ranges were resolved from a stale lockfile at
  publish time); the release script now pins internal ranges to the exact
  workspace versions itself.

## 0.0.1-beta.0

### Patch Changes

- Initial beta-channel release of the Effect Agent framework packages for live
  integration testing: the schema-first authoring core, the ephemeral
  interpreter, operational capabilities, sandbox contracts and the local
  adapter, canonical session records with the durable coordinator, the memory
  and SQLite storage adapters, the Node platform assembly, and the
  deterministic testing kit. The Cloudflare packages stay private until their
  declaration-emit blocker (TS4094) is resolved.
