### Minor Changes

- [#101](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/pull/101) [`016df57`](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/commit/016df574fa8c0f362468d848ae830d72532cbcaf) Thanks [@danieljvdm](https://github.com/danieljvdm)! - Add a Definition-owned Schema boundary for typed application run dispositions and persist valid
  ordinary-completion values on canonical `SubmissionSettled` records across crash recovery and
  replay, including materialization through the public durable Settlement API.

- [#66](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/pull/66) [`91ff50d`](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/commit/91ff50df5480a0ccdfb8e0a00db39a1576e6c34b) Thanks [@danieljvdm](https://github.com/danieljvdm)! - Harden context economics per the reviewer's second pass: the cost budget is
  enforced even when a token breach soft-lands the same response; tool results
  that cannot serialize become a bounded `UnserializableToolResult` sentinel
  instead of passing through unbounded; recovery re-seeds spend and derives
  token-exhaustion state (fail mode rejects an already-over-budget resume before
  any model call); compaction summarizer usage is staged into the canonical
  turn record; staged usage is validated as non-negative finite integers; and a
  provider-only breaching stop settles honestly as budget-exhausted.

### Minor Changes

- [#56](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/pull/56) [`5c49b78`](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/commit/5c49b786604b3e8389cdc2c54d4f5cb284eac2b7) Thanks [@danieljvdm](https://github.com/danieljvdm)! - Budget extension (D-037, ADR-0019 S3, RUN-021/SUB-034): `RunOptions` gains tightening-only
  `toolCallAllowance` and `turnAllowance` — the effective limit is
  `min(policy bound, max(1, floor(allowance)))`, never wider, and the `onExhaustion` soft landing
  keys off the effective limits. `Subagent.define` gains
  `toolCallAllowance: { default, fromParameters }`, clamped fail-closed to the delegation's
  per-invocation `SubagentPolicy.maxToolCalls` slice and threaded into ephemeral child runs, so an
  orchestrator model grants a scout more budget by re-delegating with a raised allowance (fresh
  child; never a mid-flight top-up). `projectResult` now receives a bounded
  `SubagentResultContext` whose `budgetExhausted` marker is honest on both paths — from the
  ephemeral child result's `finishReason`, or from the child Settlement's durable marker carried
  through the new optional `ChildEstablishSettled.finishReason` (threaded by the session
  coordinator shared by the DN and DC assemblies; exercised in the DN-profile durable-subagent
  suites) — so a budget-truncated partial can be surfaced in the declared success Schema. Existing one-argument `projectResult` functions keep
  compiling unchanged. Also hardens S2 containment per its autoreviewer findings: `Subagent.define`
  is overloaded so the Tool channels follow the `failureMode` value; genuine engine signals are
  classified by unspoofable provenance instead of `instanceof` on exported classes; each delegation
  exposes its canonical `containedFailure` schema (pr-review's coverage decoder now derives from
  it); and the pr-review child reviewer deliberately returns to typed exhaustion — a review is a
  coverage claim, so a budget-exhausted unit stays honestly unreviewed (contained as result data,
  never run-fatal).

- [#54](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/pull/54) [`afe755a`](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/commit/afe755a331172ffca9ceee7dd82bb452c6ccbb8a) Thanks [@danieljvdm](https://github.com/danieljvdm)! - Context economics ([#54](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/issues/54), RUN-022–027/CAP-017): application tool results are bounded by default (50 KiB
  `TruncatedToolResult` envelopes), budget accounting becomes cache-aware with last-call
  live-context tracking, every request can carry a derived run-status message, the token
  dimension joins the `onExhaustion` soft landing (RUN-018) with the `exhausted` dimension marker,
  and the engine compacts natively at the pre-Turn seam (prune, then one metered summarize)
  with a canonical `CompactionCreated` record that projections fold across Runs; provider
  context-length rejections compact-and-retry once, then fail typed (`ContextOverflowError`).

- [#63](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/pull/63) [`3a44b5f`](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/commit/3a44b5f6595f4070abb61c79d5b756a9f7ed20af) Thanks [@danieljvdm](https://github.com/danieljvdm)! - Model-visible output contract ([#41](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/issues/41), [#55](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/issues/55), RUN-028/TEST-016): every model request of a Run whose
  Agent Definition declares an output Schema now carries a framework-owned system message stating
  the final-output contract — a fixed directive plus the JSON Schema derived from the encoded side
  of `agent.definition.output` via Effect AI's derivation, inserted immediately after the request's
  last system message. The contract is a request-time projection applied after
  `RunContextHook.prepare`: official history, canonical records, run events, and the DN/DC golden
  are unchanged, and compaction cannot drop it. Context adapters receive the exact text through the
  new additive optional `RunContextRequest.outputContract` field so a limit-targeting hook can
  reserve its overhead; the field is absent entirely when the output Schema cannot render to JSON
  Schema, in which case the Run behaves exactly as before with one Turn-1 diagnostic per Attempt.
  `decodeFinalOutput` remains the conformance authority (AUTH-008). BEHAVIOR CHANGE ON UPGRADE:
  model-visible prompts grow by the rendered Schema on every request, and tests asserting
  request-message shapes will see one additional system message; hand-written JSON-shape prose in
  `instructions` becomes redundant but stays harmless.

## 0.1.0-beta.6

### Minor Changes

- [#39](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/pull/39) [`e13ee6e`](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/commit/e13ee6e7817549e99837d06e86caf2dea8656aa8) Thanks [@danieljvdm](https://github.com/danieljvdm)! - Budget soft landing (D-037, ADR-0019, RUN-018/019/020): `AgentPolicy` gains
  `onExhaustion: "final-answer" | "fail"`, defaulting to `"final-answer"` — Turn and Tool Call
  exhaustion now settle the Run through one constrained final-answer opportunity instead of failing
  it. An over-budget Tool batch settles synthetically as model-visible failed results (no handler
  starts, no durable batch declaration, exempt from repeated-failure folding), subsequent model
  requests carry `toolChoice: "none"`, Turn exhaustion admits exactly one grace Turn, and the Run
  completes with the honest `finishReason: "budget-exhausted"` on the live event, the reduced
  `AgentResult`, and (additively) the durable `SubmissionSettled` record. Duration, token, cost, and
  repeated-failure bounds stay hard rails; `onExhaustion: "fail"` preserves the prior run-fatal
  behavior exactly. BEHAVIOR CHANGE ON UPGRADE: Turn/Tool-Call budget deaths become honest
  completions unless a policy pins `"fail"` — `@effect-agent/pr-review` pins `"fail"` pending its
  containment rework.

  model-declared and programmatic broker calls, value-level failures, and delayed terminal event/
  trace commit, while isolating complete span-lifecycle defects through Effect's error reporter.
  Build Cloudflare Conversation Objects on `effect-cf`'s native `DurableObject.make` boundary so it
  owns the cached runtime, event-scoped Layers, native RPC methods, `waitUntil`, and post-RPC OTLP
  flush isolation. Upgrade to `effect-cf` 0.25.3 so the same upstream boundary flushes alarm
  telemetry. Remove Effect Agent's duplicate telemetry service, flush coordinator, timeout
  configuration, and lifecycle fixture matrix.

Also expose per-incarnation Cloudflare
  Binding capture with live Durable Object context and derived identities, and prevent incomplete
  application Tool batches from a failed or aborted Run from poisoning prompts for later Runs.

## 0.0.1-beta.4

### Patch Changes

- [#13](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/pull/13) [`f4e3786`](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/commit/f4e378635a794d4c17192ee3de011697ccec3a3b) Thanks [@danieljvdm](https://github.com/danieljvdm)! - Introduce the `effect-agent` umbrella package: the framework's complete pure
  surface — schema-first authoring (core), the bounded interpreter (engine),
  and operational capabilities — as one dependency-clean root package,
  mirroring how `effect` fronts the `@effect/*` satellites. Platform adapters
  remain scoped. The umbrella is version-fixed to its three constituents.
- Updated dependencies [[`f4e3786`](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/commit/f4e378635a794d4c17192ee3de011697ccec3a3b)]:
  - @effect-agent/core@0.0.1-beta.4

## 0.0.1-beta.3

### Patch Changes

- Adopt the MIT license across every published package, and ship the Cloudflare
  packages with type declarations for the first time: their Durable Object
  class factory now carries an explicit `ConversationObjectClass` return type,
  which unblocks TypeScript declaration emit (TS4094). Supersedes the
  0.0.1-beta.2 round (and the Cloudflare pair's 0.0.1-beta.0), which was
  published out of band from an uncommitted tree, still UNLICENSED, and without
  `.d.mts` for the Cloudflare packages.
- Updated dependencies []:
  - @effect-agent/core@0.0.1-beta.3

## 0.0.1-beta.1

### Patch Changes

- Republish with correctly pinned internal dependencies. The 0.0.1-beta.0
  artifacts depended on internal `@effect-agent/*` versions that were never
  published (`workspace:*` ranges were resolved from a stale lockfile at
  publish time); the release script now pins internal ranges to the exact
  workspace versions itself.
- Updated dependencies []:
  - @effect-agent/core@0.0.1-beta.1

## 0.0.1-beta.0

### Patch Changes

- Initial beta-channel release of the Effect Agent framework packages for live
  integration testing: the schema-first authoring core, the ephemeral
  interpreter, operational capabilities, sandbox contracts and the local
  adapter, canonical session records with the durable coordinator, the memory
  and SQLite storage adapters, the Node platform assembly, and the
  deterministic testing kit. The Cloudflare packages stay private until their
  declaration-emit blocker (TS4094) is resolved.
