# @effect-agent/storage-cloudflare

## 0.0.1-beta.3

### Patch Changes

- Adopt the MIT license across every published package, and ship the Cloudflare
  packages with type declarations for the first time: their Durable Object
  class factory now carries an explicit `ConversationObjectClass` return type,
  which unblocks TypeScript declaration emit (TS4094). Supersedes the
  0.0.1-beta.2 round (and the Cloudflare pair's 0.0.1-beta.0), which was
  published out of band from an uncommitted tree, still UNLICENSED, and without
  `.d.mts` for the Cloudflare packages.
- Updated dependencies []:
  - @effect-agent/session@0.0.1-beta.3
